To improve my C# coding skills, I have created a C# Windows application called Calculator.

*** Initially implemented all basic Arithmetic operations by taking two numbers in two textboxes and printing result in result label ***

** Implemented Backspace and Reset functionality **

* Currently, trying to implement the same functionality by taking entire input in only one textbox and displaying the result also in the same textbox *
